# Urchin

## Keyboards in Use

The keyboards I am using for this keymap are:

- [Urchin](https://github.com/duckyb/urchin)

This repository currently does NOT include certain things from the [duckyb/urchin-zmk-firmware](https://github.com/duckyb/urchin-zmk-firmware):

- Does not follow its keymap
- Does not include its use of [M165437/nice-view-gem](https://github.com/M165437/nice-view-gem/blob/main/README.md)

This keymap focuses more in adapted my common preferences and should be generally suitable for keyboards that are:

- wireless
- 34 keys
- nice!nano
- nice!view

## Notes on Shield

Original shield files are from [duckyb/urchin-zmk-module](https://github.com/duckyb/urchin-zmk-module).

It is copied over for now instead of using the `DZMK_EXTRA_MODULES` arg to compile.
