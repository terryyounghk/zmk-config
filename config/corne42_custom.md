# Corne 42-keys Custom Build

## Keyboards in Use

The keyboard I am using for this keymap is:

- [Wireless Corne with nice!view, Rotary Encoder and Joystick](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?_u=h3449j0l1a08&id=771902367795)

- wireless
- 42 keys
- nRF52840 - nice!nano 2.0 compatible MCU
- Rotary Encoder on the left
- Joystick on the right
- nice!view
