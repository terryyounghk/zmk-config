# Personal zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) config repo for my [chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi) with [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) and [nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view).

I personally prefer combos and [combo mods](https://jasoncarloscox.com/blog/combo-mods/) over [home-row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) and [tab dances](https://thomasbaart.nl/2018/12/13/qmk-basics-tap-dance/).

I am also switching preference from momentary layers to one-shot or toggle layers.
